# Polynomial regression with MShadow library tutorial

Hello, this is my second article about how to use modern C++ for solving machine learning problems. This time I will show how to make a model for polynomial regression problem described in previous [article](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/polynomial_regression), but now with another library which allows you to use your GPU easily.

For this tutorial I chose [MShadow](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow) library, you can find documentation for it [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/tree/master/doc). This library was chosen because it is actively developed now, and used as a basis for one of a wide used deep learning framework [MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/). Also it is a header only library with minimal dependencies, so it's integration is not hard at all.

Please look at previous [article](https://github.com/Kolkir/mlcpp/tree/master/polynomial_regression) to learn how to download and parse training data. 

You have pay attention on how sources for this tutorial are compiled, I used CUDA compiler for them, please look at corresponding CMakeLists.txt file for details. Also you should have installed ``gcc-6`` as host compiler for ``CUDA 9``.

0. **Preparations**
	MShadow library use special routines to initialize and shutdown itself,  I wrote a simple class to use them in RAII manner:
	``` cpp
	#include <mshadow/tensor.h>
	...
	namespace ms = mshadow;
    typedef float DType;
	...
	template <typename Device>
	struct ScopedTensorEngine {
	  ScopedTensorEngine() { ms::InitTensorEngine<Device>(); }
	  ~ScopedTensorEngine() { ms::ShutdownTensorEngine<Device>(); }
	  ScopedTensorEngine(const ScopedTensorEngine&) = delete;
	  ScopedTensorEngine& operator=(const ScopedTensorEngine&) = delete;
	};
	```
	Device template parameter can be ``ms::cpu`` or ``ms::gpu``, I will instantiate ``ScopedTensorEngine`` for both types, because I need to pass data from host side to GPU (but it is allowed to use only ``ms::cpu`` for all computations, and code will remain the same):
	```
	ScopedTensorEngine<ms::cpu> tensorEngineCpu;
	ScopedTensorEngine<ms::gpu> tensorEngineGpu;
	```
	Next I defined a variable which will represent a CUDA stream. A CUDA Stream is a sequence of operations that are performed in order on the GPU device. Streams can be run in independent concurrent in-order queues of execution, and operations in different streams can be interleaved and overlapped. This variable is necessary for using other MShadow abstractions. 
	```
	...
	using GpuStream = ms::Stream<ms::gpu>;
    using GpuStreamPtr = std::unique_ptr<GpuStream, void (*)(GpuStream*)>;
    ...
    GpuStreamPtr computeStream(ms::NewStream<ms::gpu>(true, false, -1), 
        [](GpuStream* s) { ms::DeleteStream(s); });
	```
	C++ smart pointer with custom deleter can be very useful for C style interfaces.  
	
2. **Loading data to MShadow datastructures**
	```
	  auto rows = raw_data_x.size();
	  ms::Tensor<ms::cpu, 2, DType> host_y(raw_data_y.data(), ms::Shape2(rows, 1));
  ms::TensorContainer<ms::gpu, 2, DType> gpu_y(host_y.shape_);
  gpu_y.set_stream(computeStream.get());
  ms::Copy(gpu_y, host_y, computeStream.get());
```
